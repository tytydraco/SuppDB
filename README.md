# SuppDB
A database of various supplements and their neurological profile

# Using
Click [here](https://github.com/tytydraco/SuppDB/blob/main/Supplements.csv) to access the spreadsheet online.

If there are blank entries, it is intentional. Usually, this happens when there is no proper term to use when describing a supplement.

Individuals can search the spreadsheet using the search bar. Possible search terms may include "Antidepressant", or "GABA".

# Philosophy
The goal of this project is not to explain every little intricacy of every supplement. It is to give a **general neurological profile** of the supplement to lead individuals in the right direction.

## Specifics
**Neurological profile** refers specifically to the changes made to the brain or nervous system. This includes agonism or antagonism on certain receptors, changes in hormone levels, neurotransmitter levels, etc.

# Contribution
Each supplement should specify these parameters:

- Name of the supplement, typically the most common name (ex: Lemon Balm, Taurine, 5-HTP, etc.)
- Type of compound (ex: Mineral, Herb, Amino Acid, etc.)
- Category of the supplement's effects (ex: Anxiolytic, Antidepressant, Analgesic, etc.)
- Positive interactions, such as upregulation and potentiation (ex: GABA, Dopamine, Serotonin, etc.)
- Negative interactions, such as downregulation and attenuation (ex: GABA, Dopamine, Serotonin, etc.)

Occasionally, there will be research that suggests certain neurological changes, but only in high concentrations. Use your own discretion to decide if the effect is relevent enough to be included in the profile or not.

## Doing it yourself
1. Fork the repository under your account
2. Decide which supplement you want to add or update
3. Perform some very basic research to create a neurological profile of the supplement
4. Perform your change to the spreadsheet file (either manually or with a CSV editor)
5. Create a pull request on this repository with your changes
6. Wait for moderator approval

## Requesting it
Create a [new issue](https://github.com/tytydraco/SuppDB/issues/new/choose) on the repository, and just state the name of the supplement you would like to have researched. Either I or another contributor might create the profile for you and update the database.
